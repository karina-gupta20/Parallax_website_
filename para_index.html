        <p>This project is small discussion on the topic "Winter is better than Summer"
            most of the people like Winter and most like Summer
            but according to me Winter is more better than Summer because Winter is the best climate that can produce a lot of healthy fruits and vegetables. 
            People get the opportunity to eat fresh fruits. Also, so many beautiful flowers blossom during this season. 
            Winter season provides a lot of stamina because of the freshness in the climate.
            Winter season is one of the remarkable seasons in our nation. 
            It falls between the autumn season and the spring season. 
            Nights are longer and days are short in this season. 
            Many festivals are celebrated in winter like Christmas, New year, Holi, etc.
            Winter season is very useful for wellness, farming and planting ornamental plants.
            The type of food people consume varies according to the seasons. 
            In summer, people would prefer to have cold food like ice-cream to keep them cool because the weather is so hot . 
            However, during winter, people will prefer to eat hot and spicy food which would help them to keep themselves warm.

         <p>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. It occurs after autumn and before spring. The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.

            When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions, winter brings snow and freezing temperatures. The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value; that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole. The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice and depend on latitude. They differ due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit

        <h2>SUMMER</h2> 
     </div>
     <div class="para">
         <p>Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after spring and before autumn. At or centred on the summer solstice, daylight hours are longest and darkness hours are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunrises and latest sunsets also occur near the date of the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.Summer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather. In Mediterranean climates, it is also associated with dry weather, while in other places (particularly in Eastern Asia because of the monsoon) it is associated with rainy weather. The wet season is the main period of vegetation growth within the savanna climate regime.
            Where the wet season is associated with a seasonal shift in the prevailing winds, it is known as a monsoon.

            In the northern Atlantic Ocean, a distinct tropical cyclone season occurs from 1 June to 30 November.
            The statistical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is 10 September. 
            In the North Indian basin, storms are most common from April to December, with peaks in May and November.
            In the Southern Hemisphere, the tropical cyclone season runs from the start of November until the end of April with peaks in mid-February to early March</p>
